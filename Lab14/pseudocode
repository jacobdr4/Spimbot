Notes:
-Adjust Lab 9 code
-Hard code in recourses
-Gather wood and stone to build a strong fort
-Gather wool for making a bed
-Have fatigue level
-Avoid/fight squirrels (Only happens at night), can request a night interrupt to change behavior
-Can kill opponent (Save this for only if we have time at the end)
-Put chest inside fort to store materials
-Could break opponents bed

Pseudocode:
-Get wool and wood to build bed
-Solve puzzle
-Build bed around water

Repeat 3x {
-Get 8 stone
-Solve 4 puzzles
-Build 4 walls
}

-Get 7 stone
-Get 1 wood
-Solve 4 puzzles
-Build 3 walls and 1 door
-Send fort location (Possibly everyday)

-Branch if nighttime and fort not done, move to center/run around 
to avoid squirrels/other bot (hopefully just the first night)
-Branch if need water, then go get water to rehydrate
-Branch if wall is too damaged, break wall and replace it
-Branch nothing to do, solve puzzles in fort
